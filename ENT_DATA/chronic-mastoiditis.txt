Chronic Mastoiditis: Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment
Chronic mastoiditis is a long-lasting inflammation of the mastoid bone behind the ear. It can result from untreated acute ear infections or recurring infections. This condition is significant as it can lead to
hearing loss
,
dizziness
, facial nerve paralysis, and even intracranial complications. While less common today due to prompt treatment of ear infections, chronic mastoiditis still affects individuals, primarily children. If you notice persistent
ear pain
, drainage, or swelling behind the ear, seeking medical attention promptly is crucial to prevent complications.
Causes of Chronic Mastoiditis
Chronic mastoiditis develops due to various factors like untreated acute ear infections, recurrent ear infections, incomplete healing after ear surgery, or a poorly functioning immune system. When bacteria from an untreated infection spread to the mastoid bone behind the ear, it can lead to chronic inflammation and persistent symptoms. Inadequate drainage of the middle ear, structural issues in the
ear canal
, or a history of ear surgeries can also increase the risk of chronic mastoiditis. Seeking timely medical attention for ear infections and following treatment recommendations can help prevent the progression to chronic mastoiditis.

Symptoms of Chronic Mastoiditis
Recognizing the symptoms of Chronic Mastoiditis early is crucial for improving outcomes and preventing complications. Here are some common symptoms to watch out for:
Chronic ear pain or discomfort
Persistent drainage from the ear
Hearing loss
Swelling behind the ear
Redness or tenderness over the mastoid bone
Fever
Dizziness or
vertigo
Early detection of these symptoms can lead to prompt treatment, preventing the progression of the infection and reducing the risk of serious complications. If you experience any of these symptoms, it is essential to seek medical attention promptly.
Diagnosis of Chronic Mastoiditis
Accurate diagnosis of Chronic Mastoiditis is crucial for effective treatment and to prevent complications. The diagnostic process typically involves a thorough medical history review, physical examination, and diagnostic tests. Imaging studies such as CT scans and MRI scans are commonly used to visualize the extent of the infection. Additionally, a culture of
ear discharge
may be taken to identify the causative bacteria. Tympanometry can assess middle ear function, while audiometry tests evaluate hearing loss. Prompt and precise diagnosis is vital to initiate appropriate treatment and prevent potential hearing loss or further spread of the infection.

Treatment Options for Chronic Mastoiditis
Chronic Mastoiditis treatment approaches vary depending on the severity and individual patient needs. Individualized care is crucial for successful outcomes.
Antibiotics
Antibiotics are prescribed to fight bacterial infections in the mastoid bone.
They help eliminate the bacteria causing the infection and reduce inflammation.
The primary objective is to clear the infection and prevent complications.
Patients typically take antibiotics for a specific duration as directed by their healthcare provider.
Surgery
Surgery may be necessary to remove infected mastoid bone or drain pus.
It is recommended when antibiotics are ineffective or complications arise.
The primary objective is to eliminate the source of infection and restore ear function.
Surgical procedures vary from simple
mastoidectomy
to more complex surgeries based on the extent of the infection.
Prevention and Management of Chronic Mastoiditis
Chronic Mastoiditis can be managed effectively with lifestyle changes and proactive measures. Here are some key strategies to help prevent and manage this condition:
Lifestyle Modifications:
Avoid exposure to secondhand smoke and other environmental irritants that can worsen symptoms.
Practice good ear hygiene by keeping the ears dry and clean to prevent infections.
Manage allergies effectively to reduce the risk of inflammation in the ear.
Regular Screenings:
Attend regular check-ups with an ENT specialist to monitor the condition and catch any changes early.
Discuss any concerns or symptoms with your healthcare provider promptly.
Supportive Care:
Follow the prescribed treatment plan diligently to control symptoms and prevent complications.
Seek emotional support or counseling if needed to cope with the challenges of managing a chronic condition.

Chronic mastoiditis is primarily caused by untreated acute ear infections, leading to the infection spreading to the mastoid bone.
What are the symptoms of chronic mastoiditis?
Symptoms of chronic mastoiditis include ear pain, drainage from the ear, hearing loss, and redness/swelling behind the ear.
How is chronic mastoiditis treated?
Chronic mastoiditis is typically treated with antibiotics, ear drops, and in severe cases, surgery like a mastoidectomy.
Can chronic mastoiditis cause hearing loss?
Yes, chronic mastoiditis can lead to hearing loss due to damage to the middle ear structures. Regular check-ups are crucial.
How long does it take to recover from chronic mastoiditis?
Recovery time for chronic mastoiditis varies but typically involves several weeks of antibiotic treatment and may require surgical intervention.
Can chronic mastoiditis be prevented?
Yes, chronic mastoiditis can be prevented by promptly treating ear infections, practicing good ear hygiene, and seeking medical care for persistent symptoms.
What is the difference between chronic and acute mastoiditis?
Chronic mastoiditis is a long-term, persistent infection of the mastoid bone, while acute mastoiditis is a sudden and severe infection.
What are the risks of untreated chronic mastoiditis?
Untreated chronic mastoiditis can lead to complications like hearing loss, facial paralysis, meningitis, and brain abscess.
Can chronic mastoiditis recur?
Yes, chronic mastoiditis can recur, leading to repeated symptoms and complications. Close monitoring and proper treatment are essential.
