nasal congestion
, mucus drainage,
sinus pressure
, and facial pain.
Sinus infections can be either acute, lasting for a short period, or chronic, persisting for more than twelve weeks.

Acute sinus infections typically result from a viral infection, such as the common cold, and can be accompanied by symptoms like thick
nasal discharge
, facial pain, and fever.
chronic sinusitis
, on the other hand, may be caused by factors like allergies,
nasal polyps
, or a
deviated septum
. Symptoms of chronic sinusitis include persistent nasal congestion, post-nasal drip, and reduced sense of smell.
What are the Causes of Sinus Infections?
Sinus infections can be triggered by various factors, including:
Viral infections like the common cold
Bacterial infections
Allergies such as pollen or dust
Nasal polyps or tumors
Deviated septum or structural abnormalities in the nasal passage
What is the Diagnostic Method for Sinus Infections?
Diagnosing sinus infections typically involves a combination of physical examination, medical history review, and possibly imaging tests such as CT scans or nasal endoscopy.
Your healthcare provider may also perform a nasal swab to determine the presence of bacteria or viruses.
What is the Treatment for Sinus Infections?
Treatment for sinus infections can vary based on the severity and underlying cause of the condition.
Over-the-counter decongestants or antihistamines to relieve symptoms
Prescription antibiotics for bacterial infections
Nasal corticosteroid sprays to reduce inflammation
Saline
nasal irrigation
to flush out mucus and allergens
When to Visit a Doctor?
It is essential to seek medical attention if you experience severe or persistent symptoms such as:
High fever
Severe facial pain or pressure
Difficulty breathing
Symptoms lasting longer than ten days
Home Remedies for Sinus Infections
In addition to medical treatments, you can try the following home remedies to alleviate symptoms and promote faster recovery:
Steam inhalation to help clear nasal passages
Warm compress on the face to reduce pain and pressure
Hydration to thin mucus and promote drainage
