What is the Diagnostic Method for Irritated Throat?
Diagnosing an irritated throat typically involves a physical examination by a healthcare provider. The doctor may examine the throat, neck, and ears to assess any signs of inflammation or infection.
In some cases, additional diagnostic tests may be recommended to determine the underlying cause of the throat irritation.

In more complex cases, advanced diagnostic techniques such as endoscopy or biopsy may be necessary to identify specific conditions like acid reflux or throat cancer.
