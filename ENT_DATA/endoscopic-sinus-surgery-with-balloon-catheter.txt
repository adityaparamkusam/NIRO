Endoscopic Sinus Surgery with Balloon Catheter: Indications and Recovery
Endoscopic Sinus Surgery with Balloon Catheter, also known as
balloon sinuplasty
, is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat
chronic sinusitis
.
This innovative technique involves the use of a small, flexible balloon catheter to open up blocked sinus passages, providing relief from symptoms such as
nasal congestion
, facial pain, and pressure.
Unlike traditional
sinus surgery
, which involves the removal of tissue and bone from the sinus cavities, balloon sinuplasty is a less invasive alternative that preserves the natural structure of the sinuses.
This results in faster recovery times, less post-operative pain, and minimal scarring.
If you have been struggling with chronic sinusitis and are seeking a safe and effective treatment option, Endoscopic Sinus Surgery with Balloon Catheter may be the right choice for you.
