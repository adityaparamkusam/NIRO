Itchy Ear Canal: Causes and Diagnosis
Itchy ear canal, also known as pruritus in the
ear canal
, is a common condition characterized by an uncomfortable sensation of itching within the ear.
This sensation can range from mild to severe and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as pain, redness, swelling, and discharge.
Itchy ear canal can be caused by various factors, including ear infections, fungal infections, earwax buildup, allergic reactions, eczema, and more. It is essential to identify the underlying cause of the itching to determine the appropriate treatment.
What are the Forms of Itchy Ear Canal?
There are several forms of itchy ear canal, each with its specific symptoms and related concepts.
