What are the Causes of Sinus Tenderness?
Sinus tenderness can be caused by various factors, including infections, allergies, and structural issues.
sinus infections
: Viral, bacterial, or fungal infections can lead to inflammation of the sinuses.
Allergies: Allergic reactions to pollen, dust, or pet dander can trigger sinus inflammation.
nasal polyps
: Benign growths in the nasal passages can obstruct
sinus drainage
and lead to tenderness.

Other factors that can contribute to sinus tenderness include smoking, air pollution, and immune system disorders. Identifying the underlying cause of sinus tenderness is essential for effective treatment and management.
What is the Diagnostic Method for Sinus Tenderness?
Diagnosing sinus tenderness typically involves a physical examination, medical history review, and possibly imaging tests.
Palpate the sinuses to assess tenderness and swelling.
Perform a nasal endoscopy to visualize the nasal passages and sinus openings.
Order a CT scan or MRI to get detailed images of the sinuses and detect any abnormalities.
In some cases, a nasal swab may be taken to determine the presence of bacteria or fungi in the sinuses. These diagnostic methods help healthcare providers identify the underlying cause of sinus tenderness and develop an appropriate treatment plan.
What is the Treatment for Sinus Tenderness?
Treatment for sinus tenderness aims to relieve symptoms, reduce inflammation, and address the underlying cause.
Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.
Nasal decongestants to reduce nasal congestion and swelling.
Nasal saline irrigation to flush out mucus and allergens from the sinuses.
Prescription antibiotics for bacterial sinus infections.
Allergy medications to manage allergic reactions contributing to sinus inflammation.
In severe cases or chronic sinusitis, advanced treatments like corticosteroid nasal sprays, sinus surgery, or immunotherapy may be recommended. Lifestyle changes such as staying hydrated, using a humidifier, and avoiding triggers like cigarette smoke can also help manage sinus tenderness.
