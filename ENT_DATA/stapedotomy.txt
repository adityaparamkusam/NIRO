Stapedotomy: Indications and Recovery
Stapedotomy is a surgical procedure aimed at improving hearing by replacing the stapes bone in the middle ear. This procedure is often recommended for patients suffering from conductive
hearing loss
, especially those with
otosclerosis
.
Stapedotomy is known for its high success rate in restoring hearing and improving overall quality of life for individuals experiencing hearing difficulties.
If you are considering stapedotomy surgery, it is essential to consult with an experienced ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to discuss your options and determine if this procedure is the best course of action for your condition.
By choosing a skilled surgeon and a reputable medical facility, you can ensure that you receive the best treatment for stapedotomy.
Indications of Stapedotomy
Stapedotomy is typically recommended for individuals with otosclerosis, a condition characterized by abnormal bone growth in the middle ear. This growth can cause the stapes bone to become fixed and unable to vibrate properly, leading to conductive hearing loss.
Severe hearing loss in one or both ears
Difficulty hearing in noisy environments
tinnitus
(ringing in the ears)
Feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear
If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is essential to consult with an ENT specialist to determine the underlying cause of your hearing loss and explore treatment options, including stapedotomy surgery.
Steps involved in Stapedotomy Surgery
Stapedotomy surgery is a delicate procedure that involves replacing the fixed stapes bone with a prosthetic device to restore hearing function.
Administration of anesthesia to ensure the patient is comfortable and pain-free during the procedure
Making a small incision in the
ear canal
to access the middle ear
Removing the fixed stapes bone and replacing it with a small piston-like device
Testing the new device to ensure proper function and hearing improvement
Closing the incision with dissolvable stitches
Stapedotomy surgery is usually performed under local or general anesthesia and may take around 1-2 hours to complete. Following the procedure, patients can expect a significant improvement in their hearing ability.
Who will perform Stapedotomy Surgery?
Stapedotomy surgery is typically performed by an otolaryngologist, also known as an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist.
These highly trained medical professionals have expertise in diagnosing and treating a wide range of ear, nose, and throat conditions, including conductive hearing loss caused by otosclerosis.
Before undergoing stapedotomy surgery, it is essential to choose a skilled and experienced ENT surgeon who has a proven track record of successful outcomes with this procedure.

ear pressure
, which can be managed with prescribed pain medication.
