Vocal Cord Spasms: Causes and Diagnosis
Vocal cord spasms, also known as laryngospasms, are sudden involuntary contractions of the vocal cords, causing a temporary closure of the airway. This condition can result in difficulty breathing, speaking, or swallowing.
The symptoms of vocal cord spasms may vary from mild to severe, with some individuals experiencing throat tightness, voice muscle spasms, or a feeling of choking.
Laryngospasms can be triggered by various factors, including stress, respiratory infections, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or irritants in the air. In some cases, vocal cord spasms may occur without an apparent cause.
It is essential to understand the different forms of vocal cord spasms and their specific symptoms to seek appropriate treatment.
What are the Forms of Vocal Cord Spasms?
There are two primary forms of vocal cord spasms: adductor
spasmodic dysphonia
and abductor spasmodic dysphonia. Adductor spasmodic dysphonia involves the vocal cords closing together tightly, leading to a strained or strangled voice quality.
On the other hand, abductor spasmodic dysphonia causes the vocal cords to open suddenly during speech, resulting in a breathy or whispery voice.
Symptoms of adductor spasmodic dysphonia:
Voice breaks or interruptions during speech
Strained or strangled voice quality
Difficulty speaking for extended periods
Symptoms of abductor spasmodic dysphonia:
Breathiness or whispery voice
Voice fades in and out during speech
difficulty projecting voice
What are the Causes of Vocal Cord Spasms?
The causes of vocal cord spasms can be attributed to a variety of factors, including:
Stress: Emotional stress or anxiety can trigger vocal cord spasms in susceptible individuals.
Respiratory infections: Conditions like bronchitis or pneumonia can irritate the airways, leading to vocal cord spasms.
GERD: Gastroesophageal reflux disease can cause acid reflux, which may reach the vocal cords and trigger spasms.
Irritants: Exposure to irritants such as smoke, pollution, or strong odors can irritate the vocal cords and induce spasms.
What is the Diagnostic Method for Vocal Cord Spasms?
The diagnosis of vocal cord spasms typically involves a thorough evaluation by an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist.
Medical history assessment: The doctor will inquire about symptoms, triggers, and medical history related to vocal cord spasms.
Physical examination: The ENT specialist may perform a physical examination of the throat and vocal cords to assess any abnormalities.
Laryngoscopy: This procedure involves using a flexible or rigid scope to visualize the vocal cords and diagnose any spasms or irregularities.
Voice evaluation: A speech-language pathologist may conduct voice tests to assess vocal cord function and identify any abnormalities.
What is the Treatment for Vocal Cord Spasms?
Treatment for vocal cord spasms may vary depending on the underlying cause and severity of symptoms.
voice therapy
: Speech therapy techniques can help improve vocal cord function and reduce spasms.
Medications: Muscle relaxants or anti-anxiety medications may be prescribed to alleviate vocal cord spasms.
Botox injections: Botulinum toxin injections can temporarily paralyze the vocal cords, reducing spasms and improving voice quality.
Surgical intervention: In severe cases, surgical procedures like laryngeal nerve resection may be considered to treat vocal cord spasms.
When to Visit a Doctor?
It is essential to seek medical attention if you experience persistent or severe symptoms of vocal cord spasms, including:
Difficulty breathing or swallowing
Recurrent voice muscle spasms
Chronic throat tightness or discomfort
Voice changes or
hoarseness
lasting more than two weeks
Home Remedies for Vocal Cord Spasms
In addition to medical treatments, there are several home remedies that may help alleviate symptoms of vocal cord spasms:
Stay hydrated: Drink plenty of water to keep the vocal cords lubricated and reduce spasms.
Avoid irritants: Steer clear of smoke, pollution, or strong odors that may trigger vocal cord spasms.
Practice relaxation techniques: Stress management techniques like deep breathing or meditation can help reduce vocal cord spasms.
Rest your voice: Avoid straining your voice or speaking loudly for extended periods to prevent vocal cord spasms.
Overall, vocal cord spasms can be a challenging condition to manage, but with proper diagnosis and treatment, individuals can find relief from symptoms and improve their vocal cord function.
If you suspect you may be experiencing vocal cord spasms, consult an ENT specialist for a comprehensive evaluation and personalized treatment plan.
