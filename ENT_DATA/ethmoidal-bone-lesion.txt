The primary goal is to completely excise the lesion while preserving surrounding healthy tissue.
The steps may include pre-operative evaluation, lesion removal, and post-operative care.
Radiation Therapy
Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to target and destroy cancer cells.
It is often used when surgery is not feasible or to complement surgical treatment.
The main objective is to shrink or eliminate the lesion while minimizing damage to nearby structures.
Phases may involve treatment planning, radiation sessions, and monitoring for side effects.

Eustachian tube dysfunction can be caused by factors like allergies, sinus infections, or a blockage in the tube due to a lesion on the ethmoidal bone.
How does Eustachian tube dysfunction affect hearing?
Eustachian tube dysfunction can affect hearing by disrupting pressure balance in the middle ear, leading to hearing loss or ear fullness.
What are the symptoms of Eustachian tube dysfunction?
Symptoms of Eustachian tube dysfunction include ear pain, pressure, muffled hearing, and popping sensations in the ear.
Can Eustachian tube dysfunction cause ear infections?
Eustachian tube dysfunction can lead to ear infections due to poor ventilation and fluid buildup in the middle ear.
How is Eustachian tube dysfunction treated?
Treat Eustachian tube dysfunction with decongestants, antihistamines, nasal steroids, or tympanostomy tube placement as needed.
Are there any home remedies for Eustachian tube dysfunction?
Home remedies like steam inhalation, nasal irrigation, and staying hydrated can help manage Eustachian tube dysfunction at home.
How long does Eustachian tube dysfunction last?
Eustachian tube dysfunction duration varies but typically lasts a few weeks. See an ENT specialist for evaluation and management.
Can Eustachian tube dysfunction affect balance?
Eustachian tube dysfunction can indirectly affect balance by disrupting pressure regulation in the middle ear, impacting the vestibular system.
Is surgery necessary for Eustachian tube dysfunction?
Surgery is not typically necessary for Eustachian tube dysfunction unless there's an underlying issue like a severe ethmoidal bone lesion.
