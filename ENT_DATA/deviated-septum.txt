Deviated Septum: Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment
A deviated septum occurs when the thin wall between your nostrils is displaced to one side, making one nasal passage smaller than the other. This can lead to breathing difficulties,
nasal congestion
, frequent
sinus infections
, and
snoring
. It's a common condition, with around 80% of people having some degree of septal deviation. While not everyone with a deviated septum experiences symptoms, those who do may benefit from treatment to improve their quality of life. If you suspect you have a deviated septum, consulting an ENT specialist is recommended for proper evaluation and management.
Causes of Deviated Septum
A deviated septum can result from genetics, where the nasal septum is naturally crooked or misaligned.
Facial trauma or injury to the nose can also lead to a deviated septum.
Birth defects affecting the nasal septum can contribute to its deviation.
Repeatedly blowing the nose aggressively or incorrectly can cause a deviated septum over time.
Environmental factors like pollution or allergies may inflame nasal tissues, potentially leading to a deviated septum.
Symptoms of Deviated Septum
Recognizing the symptoms of a deviated septum is crucial as early detection can lead to better outcomes. Common symptoms include:
Nasal congestion, usually on one side
Frequent sinus infections
Nosebleeds
Facial pain or pressure
Loud breathing or snoring during sleep
Difficulty breathing through the nose
Identifying these signs promptly can help in timely intervention and management of a deviated septum, potentially improving quality of life and preventing complications.
Diagnosis of Deviated Septum
Accurate diagnosis of a Deviated Septum is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan. Diagnosis typically involves a thorough examination of the nasal passages and septum. Diagnostic methods may include:
Physical examination of the nose and nasal passages
Medical history review to assess symptoms
Nasal endoscopy to visualize the septum
Imaging tests like CT scans or MRI for detailed views
Each of these diagnostic tools helps ENT specialists identify the extent of septal deviation and any associated complications, guiding them in providing the most effective treatment for the patient.
Treatment Options for Deviated Septum
When it comes to treating a deviated septum, it's crucial to prioritize individualized care to address each patient's specific needs effectively.
Steroid Nasal Sprays
Steroid nasal sprays reduce inflammation in the nasal passages.
They help shrink swollen tissues and improve nasal airflow.
The primary objective is to alleviate nasal congestion and improve breathing.
Patient typically applies the spray daily for a specified duration.
Septoplasty Surgery
Septoplasty is a surgical procedure to straighten the nasal septum.
It is used when conservative measures fail to provide relief.
The primary objective is to correct structural deformities and improve airflow.
The procedure involves reshaping or removing parts of the deviated septum.
Turbinoplasty
Turbinoplasty aims to reduce the size of the nasal turbinates.
It helps reduce nasal congestion and improve breathing.
The primary objective is to enhance nasal airflow and reduce congestion.
The procedure involves reducing the size of the turbinates through various techniques.
Prevention and Management of Deviated Septum
When it comes to managing or preventing a Deviated Septum, lifestyle changes and proactive measures play a crucial role. Here are some ways you can take control of your health:
Lifestyle Modifications:
Avoid smoking as it can worsen nasal congestion.
Use a humidifier to keep the air moist, reducing irritation in the nasal passages.
Avoid allergens that can trigger nasal congestion.
Regular Screenings:
Visit an ENT specialist for periodic check-ups to monitor your nasal health.
Discuss any symptoms or concerns with your doctor promptly.
Supportive Care:
Use saline nasal sprays to keep the nasal passages moist and clear.
Practice good hygiene to prevent infections that can exacerbate symptoms.
