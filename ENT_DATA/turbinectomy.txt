Turbinectomy: Indications and Recovery
Turbinectomy, also known as
nasal turbinate reduction
or turbinate surgery, is a procedure that aims to alleviate
nasal obstruction
caused by enlarged nasal turbinates.
This surgery can significantly improve airflow through the nasal passages, leading to better breathing and overall quality of life.
If you are experiencing chronic
nasal congestion
, difficulty breathing through your nose, or recurrent
sinus infections
, turbinectomy may be the right treatment for you.
Consulting with an ENT specialist is the first step in determining if you are a candidate for this procedure.
Indications of Turbinectomy
Turbinectomy is typically recommended for individuals with enlarged nasal turbinates that obstruct airflow through the nasal passages.
Chronic nasal congestion
Difficulty breathing through the nose
Recurrent sinus infections
Nasal obstruction that does not improve with conservative treatments
Your ENT specialist will evaluate your symptoms, medical history, and perform a physical examination to determine if turbinectomy is the appropriate treatment for your condition.
Steps involved in Turbinectomy Surgery
Turbinectomy surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia, although in some cases, local anesthesia with sedation may be used.
The surgeon makes an incision inside the nose to access the nasal turbinates.
The excess tissue in the turbinates is removed or repositioned to improve airflow.
The incision is closed with dissolvable stitches.
Nasal packing may be placed to support the healing process.
The duration of the surgery depends on the extent of the turbinate reduction needed and typically lasts between 30 minutes to an hour.
Who will perform Turbinectomy Surgery?
Turbinectomy surgery is performed by an otolaryngologist, also known as an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist.
These highly trained medical professionals have expertise in diagnosing and treating conditions affecting the ears, nose, and throat, including nasal obstruction caused by enlarged turbinates.
It is essential to choose a board-certified ENT specialist with experience in performing turbinate surgery to ensure the best possible outcome.
Your surgeon will discuss the procedure in detail, answer any questions you may have, and address any concerns before the surgery.
Preparing for Turbinectomy Surgery
Before undergoing turbinectomy surgery, your ENT specialist will provide you with pre-operative instructions to help you prepare for the procedure.
Avoiding food and drink for a specified period before the surgery
Stopping certain medications that may increase the risk of bleeding
Arranging for transportation to and from the surgical facility
Planning for time off work or other responsibilities during the recovery period
Following your surgeon's pre-operative instructions is crucial to ensure a smooth and successful turbinectomy surgery.
Recovery after Turbinectomy surgery
The recovery period after turbinectomy surgery varies from patient to patient but typically lasts between one to two weeks. During this time, you may experience some discomfort, swelling, and nasal congestion as your body heals.
Your ENT specialist will provide you with post-operative instructions to help you manage your recovery effectively.
Taking prescribed pain medications as needed
Using saline nasal sprays to keep the nasal passages moist
Avoiding strenuous activities and heavy lifting
Attending follow-up appointments with your surgeon for post-operative care
It is essential to follow your surgeon's instructions carefully to promote proper healing and achieve the best possible results from your turbinectomy surgery.
Before and After Turbinectomy surgery
Before turbinectomy surgery, you may have been struggling with chronic nasal congestion, difficulty breathing through your nose, or recurrent sinus infections. These symptoms can significantly impact your quality of life and overall well-being.
After turbinectomy surgery, many patients experience a significant improvement in their ability to breathe through their nose and a reduction in nasal congestion. This can lead to better sleep, increased energy levels, and a higher quality of life overall.
If you are considering turbinectomy surgery, discussing your symptoms and treatment options with an ENT specialist is the first step towards finding relief from nasal obstruction.
By taking proactive steps to address your nasal issues, you can improve your breathing and enjoy a better quality of life.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is a turbinectomy?
A turbinectomy is a surgical procedure to reduce the size of the turbinates in the nose to improve nasal airflow.
How is a turbinectomy performed?
A turbinectomy is typically performed using endoscopic surgery, where the surgeon uses a small camera and specialized instruments to remove part of or the entire turbinate to improve nasal airflow.
Why would a turbinectomy be necessary?
A turbinectomy may be needed if you have chronic nasal congestion that does not improve with other treatments, such as medications or nasal sprays.
How long does recovery take after a turbinectomy?
Recovery after a turbinectomy typically takes about 1 to 2 weeks.
Are there risks associated with turbinectomy?
Yes, turbinectomy, a surgical procedure to reduce the size of nasal turbinates, can have risks such as bleeding, infection, scarring, and changes in nasal airflow. It's essential to discuss these risks with your doctor before the procedure.
How effective is a turbinectomy for treating nasal obstruction?
A turbinectomy can be effective in treating nasal obstruction by removing or reducing the size of the turbinates, which are structures inside the nose that can block airflow. It is important to discuss the risks and benefits of this procedure with an ENT specialist to determine if it is the right option for you.
What conditions can be treated with turbinectomy?
Turbinectomy is a surgical procedure used to treat chronic nasal congestion caused by enlarged turbinates due to conditions like chronic rhinitis, nasal polyps, or a deviated septum.
Is a turbinectomy a permanent solution for nasal breathing issues?
A turbinectomy can provide long-lasting relief for nasal breathing problems by reducing the size of the turbinates in the nose, but it may not always be a permanent solution as regrowth of the turbinates can occur in some cases.
What is the success rate of turbinectomy?
The success rate of turbinectomy in improving nasal breathing varies, but most people experience significant relief from nasal congestion after the procedure.
Is turbinectomy covered by insurance?
Turbinectomy is typically covered by insurance if it is deemed medically necessary and not just for cosmetic reasons. It is best to check with your insurance provider to confirm coverage for this procedure.
