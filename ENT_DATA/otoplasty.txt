Steps involved in Otoplasty Surgery
Otoplasty surgery typically involves several steps to reshape the ears and achieve the desired results. The procedure is performed under local anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia, depending on the extent of the correction needed and the patient's preference.
An incision is made behind the ear to access the cartilage
The cartilage is reshaped, folded, or removed to reposition the ears
Sutures are used to secure the newly shaped ear in place
The incision is closed, and a dressing is applied to protect the ears
The duration of Otoplasty surgery varies depending on the complexity of the correction required but typically takes between one to two hours to complete.
After the procedure, patients can expect some swelling, bruising, and discomfort, which can be managed with pain medication and proper care.
