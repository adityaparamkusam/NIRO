Endoscopic Nasal Surgery: Indications and Recovery
Endoscopic Nasal Surgery is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat various nasal conditions, including
chronic sinusitis
,
nasal polyps
,
deviated septum
, and nasal blockages.
This innovative surgical technique allows for precise visualization and treatment of the nasal passages using an endoscope, a thin, flexible tube with a camera attached.
Endoscopic Nasal Surgery is often recommended when conservative treatments have failed to provide relief or improvement.
Indications of Endoscopic Nasal Surgery
Endoscopic Nasal Surgery may be recommended for individuals experiencing symptoms such as
nasal congestion
, facial pain or pressure, post-nasal drip, headaches,
loss of smell
, and recurrent
sinus infections
.
These symptoms can significantly impact a person's quality of life and daily functioning. If you have been diagnosed with chronic nasal conditions or have persistent nasal blockages, your healthcare provider may suggest Endoscopic Nasal Surgery as a potential treatment option.
Steps involved in Endoscopic Nasal Surgery Surgery
During Endoscopic Nasal Surgery, the surgeon will insert the endoscope into the nasal passages to visualize the anatomy and identify any abnormalities or blockages.
Small instruments are then used to remove nasal polyps, correct a deviated septum, or widen the sinus openings to improve drainage.
The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia on an outpatient basis, meaning you can go home the same day.
Who will perform Endoscopic Nasal Surgery Surgery?
Endoscopic Nasal Surgery is usually performed by an otolaryngologist, also known as an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist. These highly trained physicians have extensive experience in diagnosing and treating conditions of the nose, sinuses, and throat.
Your ENT surgeon will work closely with you to develop a personalized treatment plan based on your individual needs and goals.
Preparing for Endoscopic Nasal Surgery Surgery
Before undergoing Endoscopic Nasal Surgery, your healthcare provider will conduct a thorough evaluation to assess your overall health and determine if you are a suitable candidate for the procedure.
You may be asked to stop taking certain medications, such as blood thinners, in the days leading up to surgery. It is essential to follow your surgeon's instructions carefully to ensure a successful outcome.
Recovery after Endoscopic Nasal Surgery surgery
After Endoscopic Nasal Surgery, you can expect some mild discomfort, swelling, and congestion in the nose for a few days. Your healthcare provider may prescribe pain medication and nasal sprays to help manage these symptoms.
Most patients can resume normal activities within a week following surgery, although strenuous exercise and heavy lifting should be avoided for a few weeks.
It is crucial to attend follow-up appointments with your surgeon to monitor your progress and address any concerns.
