Treatment Options for Acute Sinusitis
When it comes to treating Acute Sinusitis, individualized care is crucial for successful management. Tailoring treatment to each patient's specific needs can lead to better outcomes. Here are the main approaches to treating Acute Sinusitis:
Antibiotics
Antibiotics are prescribed to eliminate bacterial infections in the sinuses.

The primary objective is to clear the infection and reduce inflammation.
Patients may need to take antibiotics for 5-14 days depending on the severity of the infection.
Nasal Decongestants
Nasal decongestants help reduce nasal congestion by shrinking swollen nasal passages.
They work by constricting the blood vessels in the nasal passages, relieving congestion.
The main goal is to alleviate symptoms such as stuffiness and improve breathing.
Patients should use nasal decongestants for a limited time to avoid rebound congestion.
Nasal Saline Irrigation
Nasal saline irrigation involves flushing out the nasal passages with a saline solution.
This treatment helps clear mucus and allergens from the sinuses, reducing inflammation.
The primary objective is to keep the nasal passages moist and clear of irritants.
Patients can perform nasal saline irrigation multiple times a day using a neti pot or squeeze bottle.
