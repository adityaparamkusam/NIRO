Microscopic examination: Using a magnifying instrument to inspect the ear canal and identify any signs of infection or inflammation.
Allergy testing: Conducting skin tests or blood tests to determine if allergies are contributing to ear itching.
In some cases, imaging tests like CT scans or MRIs may be recommended to assess the internal structures of the ear and rule out any underlying conditions.
The diagnostic method for ear itching may vary depending on the individual's symptoms and medical history.
