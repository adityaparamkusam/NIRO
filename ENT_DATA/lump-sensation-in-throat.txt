Lump Sensation in Throat: Treatment and Remedies
Lump sensation in the throat, also known as globus sensation, is a common condition characterized by the feeling of a lump or foreign object stuck in the throat.
Individuals experiencing this sensation may feel as though there is something obstructing their throat, making it difficult to swallow or causing discomfort.
While it can be distressing, globus sensation is usually benign and not indicative of a serious underlying health issue.
Symptoms of lump sensation in the throat may vary from person to person but commonly include a persistent feeling of a lump in the throat,
difficulty swallowing
, throat irritation, and the sensation of something being stuck.
It is essential to differentiate this sensation from actual physical obstructions in the throat, such as tumors or swollen lymph nodes, which may require medical intervention.
Globus sensation can be triggered by various factors, including gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), post-nasal drip, throat irritation, anxiety, muscle tension, and even thyroid issues.
Understanding the potential causes can help in identifying the underlying reason for the sensation and determining the appropriate course of action for treatment.
