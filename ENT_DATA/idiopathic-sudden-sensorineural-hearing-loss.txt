Treatment Options for Idiopathic Sudden Sensorineural Hearing Loss
Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss (ISSHL) requires individualized care tailored to each patient's specific needs. Here are the main approaches to treating ISSHL:
Steroid Therapy
Steroid therapy involves the administration of corticosteroids orally or through injections.
This treatment aims to reduce inflammation in the inner ear and improve hearing.
The primary objective is to restore hearing and reduce the severity of symptoms.
The treatment typically involves an initial high dose followed by a tapering regimen.
Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy exposes patients to pure oxygen in a pressurized chamber.
This treatment increases oxygen levels in the inner ear, promoting healing and recovery.
The main goal is to improve blood flow and restore hearing function.
Patient undergoes multiple sessions inside a hyperbaric chamber over a specified period.
Hearing Aids
Hearing aids are devices worn in or behind the ear to amplify sound for better hearing.
They help compensate for the hearing loss and improve overall communication.
The primary objective is to enhance the patient's ability to hear and engage in daily activities.
The process involves fitting the patient with appropriate hearing aids and providing necessary adjustments.
