It is used to kill remaining cancer cells after surgery or as the primary treatment.
The primary objective is to eradicate cancer cells.
The phases involve treatment planning, radiation sessions, and monitoring for side effects.
Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells throughout the body.
It may be used when tumors are advanced or have spread.
The primary objective is to shrink tumors or slow their growth.
The treatment may involve multiple cycles of chemotherapy over a period of time.
