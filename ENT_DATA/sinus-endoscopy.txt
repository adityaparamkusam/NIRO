Steps involved in Sinus Endoscopy Surgery
During Sinus Endoscopy, a thin, flexible tube with a camera at the tip is inserted into the nostrils to visualize the sinus cavities.
The surgeon can then identify any abnormalities, such as polyps or inflammation, and perform necessary treatments using specialized instruments.
The surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia in an outpatient setting, meaning you can go home the same day. The duration of the procedure may vary depending on the complexity of the issue being addressed.
Who will perform Sinus Endoscopy Surgery?
Sinus Endoscopy surgery is usually performed by an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist) who has received specialized training in endoscopic procedures. These surgeons have the expertise to navigate the delicate structures of the sinus cavities and perform precise treatments.
Before undergoing Sinus Endoscopy, it is essential to consult with your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms, medical history, and any potential risks or complications associated with the procedure.
