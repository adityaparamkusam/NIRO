Steps involved in Tracheostomy Surgery
Tracheostomy surgery typically involves the following steps:

A breathing tube is inserted through the incision into the trachea.
The tracheal tube is secured in place with sutures or a tracheostomy tube holder.
The patient is connected to a ventilator to assist with breathing during and after the procedure.
The entire process is done under anesthesia to ensure the patient is comfortable and pain-free. The healthcare team will closely monitor vital signs and adjust the ventilator settings as needed to support breathing.
After the procedure, the patient will receive post-operative care to ensure proper healing of the tracheostomy site and optimal respiratory function. The healthcare team will provide instructions on tracheostomy care and management to promote a smooth recovery.
