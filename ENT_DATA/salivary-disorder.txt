Salivary disorders affect the production or flow of saliva in your mouth. This can lead to dry mouth,
difficulty swallowing
, or even infections. These disorders are significant as saliva is crucial for digestion, oral health, and overall comfort.

If you're facing symptoms like constant thirst, changes in taste, or dry throat, it's essential to consult an ENT specialist for proper evaluation and management. Don't hesitate to seek help and improve your quality of life.
Causes of Salivary Disorder
