The steps include pre-operative assessment, surgical excision, and post-operative care.
Endoscopic Resection
Endoscopic resection is a minimally invasive procedure using a thin, flexible tube with a camera to remove the papilloma.
This approach aims to preserve surrounding healthy tissue while effectively removing the tumor.
The primary objective is to achieve complete removal of the papilloma with minimal impact on nasal function.
The phases involve pre-operative evaluation, endoscopic removal, and post-operative follow-up.
Close Monitoring
Regular follow-up visits and imaging studies are conducted to monitor the papilloma's growth and detect any recurrence early.
Monitoring helps in timely intervention if there are signs of regrowth or malignant transformation.
The primary objective is to ensure early detection and prompt management of any recurrence.
The process includes periodic check-ups, imaging studies, and symptom assessment.
