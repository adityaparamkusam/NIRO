Audiometry tests to assess hearing loss, if present.
Tympanometry to measure the movement of the eardrum and middle
ear pressure
.
Treatment Options for Acute Serous Otitis Media
Acute Serous Otitis Media requires individualized care to ensure the best outcomes. Treatment approaches may include watchful waiting, antibiotics, or ear tube surgery.
Watchful Waiting
This approach involves monitoring the condition without immediate medical intervention.

Ear Tube Surgery
Ear tube surgery involves placing tiny tubes through the eardrum to ventilate the middle ear and drain fluid.
This procedure is often recommended for recurrent or persistent cases of Acute Serous Otitis Media.
The primary objective is to improve hearing, reduce the risk of future infections, and relieve symptoms.
The surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia and has a high success rate.
