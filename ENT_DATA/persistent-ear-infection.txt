The primary objective is to clear the infection and prevent its recurrence.
This treatment usually involves a course of antibiotics prescribed by a healthcare provider.
Ear Tubes (Tympanostomy Tubes)
Ear tubes are tiny cylinders placed through the eardrum to promote ventilation and equalize pressure in the middle ear.
They are used when persistent fluid buildup or recurrent infections are not resolved with other treatments.
The primary objective is to improve hearing, prevent future infections, and reduce the need for repeated antibiotic courses.
The procedure involves a short surgical intervention performed by an ENT specialist.
