Frequently Asked Questions
What is submucosal resection?
Submucosal resection is a surgical procedure where a portion of the mucous membrane and underlying tissue is removed.
How is submucosal resection performed?
Submucosal resection is typically done using an endoscope, a thin, flexible tube with a light and camera attached. The doctor passes small instruments through the endoscope to remove abnormal tissue from the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.
What conditions are treated with submucosal resection?
Submucosal resection is primarily used to treat conditions such as nasal polyps, chronic sinusitis, and certain nasal tumors.
How long does recovery take after submucosal resection?
Recovery after submucosal resection typically takes about 1 to 2 weeks. Your doctor will provide you with specific instructions on post-operative care to help you recover smoothly.
Are there risks associated with submucosal resection?
Yes, like any surgical procedure, submucosal resection carries risks such as bleeding, infection, and damage to nearby structures. Your doctor will discuss these risks with you before the procedure.
How successful is submucosal resection in treating nasal obstruction?
Submucosal resection is generally successful in treating nasal obstruction caused by a deviated septum or enlarged turbinates. It can improve airflow through the nose, reduce congestion, and help with breathing.
What is the difference between submucosal resection and other sinus surgeries?
Submucosal resection is a type of sinus surgery that involves removing specific tissue in the nasal passage. Other sinus surgeries may involve different techniques such as widening the sinus openings or removing nasal polyps.
How does submucosal resection improve nasal airflow?
Submucosal resection helps improve nasal airflow by reducing the size of nasal turbinates, which are structures inside the nose that can become enlarged and obstruct normal breathing.
Can submucosal resection be done in conjunction with other sinus surgeries?
Yes, submucosal resection can be performed in combination with other sinus surgeries to address specific nasal issues effectively.
Is submucosal resection covered by insurance?
Submucosal resection is typically covered by insurance if it is considered medically necessary. It's best to check with your insurance provider to confirm coverage for this procedure.
