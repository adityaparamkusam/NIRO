Salivary Gland Disorders: Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment
Salivary gland disorders refer to conditions affecting the glands that produce saliva in your mouth. These disorders can impact your ability to eat, speak, and swallow comfortably. They are not very common but can still affect individuals of any age. While some disorders may cause pain and swelling, others can lead to dry mouth or difficulty tasting food. Seeking medical attention is crucial to diagnose and treat these conditions effectively. If you experience symptoms like mouth dryness or persistent pain in the salivary glands, consulting a healthcare provider is essential for proper management.
Causes of Salivary Gland Disorders
Salivary gland disorders can arise due to various factors. These include dehydration, infections, blockages in the ducts, autoimmune conditions, medications, radiation therapy, and underlying medical conditions like diabetes or HIV. These factors can disrupt the normal functioning of the salivary glands, leading to issues such as dry mouth, swelling, pain, or the formation of stones. Understanding these factors can help in the diagnosis and management of salivary gland disorders.

is a minimally invasive procedure that allows the doctor to visualize and treat blockages in the salivary ducts.
It is used to remove stones or other obstructions that may be causing symptoms.
The primary objective is to restore normal salivary flow and prevent recurrent blockages.
The procedure typically involves inserting a thin endoscope into the duct to remove the blockage.
Surgery
Surgery may be necessary for more complex or severe cases of salivary gland disorders.
It is used to remove tumors, cysts, or parts of the salivary gland that are causing problems.
The primary objective is to treat the underlying issue and improve overall gland function.
Surgical procedures vary depending on the specific condition but may involve gland removal or tumor excision.
