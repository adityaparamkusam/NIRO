Steps involved in Sphenopalatine Artery Ligation Surgery
During the procedure, the surgeon will locate the sphenopalatine artery, which is a major blood vessel that supplies blood to the nasal cavity. The artery is then ligated or tied off to stop the blood flow and prevent further bleeding.
Sphenopalatine artery ligation is typically performed under local anesthesia, and most patients can go home the same day. The procedure is minimally invasive, with small incisions made inside the nose to access the artery.
Who will perform Sphenopalatine Artery Ligation Surgery?
Sphenopalatine artery ligation surgery is usually performed by an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) surgeon who specializes in treating nasal and sinus conditions.
These surgeons have the expertise and training to safely perform the procedure and ensure optimal outcomes for patients.
Before undergoing sphenopalatine artery ligation surgery, it is essential to consult with a qualified ENT surgeon to discuss the benefits, risks, and expected outcomes of the procedure.
Preparing for Sphenopalatine Artery Ligation Surgery
Before the surgery, your healthcare provider will provide you with specific instructions on how to prepare.
This may include fasting for a certain period before the procedure, avoiding certain medications that can increase bleeding risk, and arranging for someone to drive you home after the surgery.

Recovery after Sphenopalatine Artery Ligation surgery

Before and After Sphenopalatine Artery Ligation surgery
Before sphenopalatine artery ligation surgery, you may have tried other treatments such as nasal packing, cauterization, or medications to control nosebleeds.
