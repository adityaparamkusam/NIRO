Recurrent Mouth Ulcers: Causes and Diagnosis
Recurrent mouth ulcers, also known as canker sores, are painful lesions that develop on the mucous membranes inside the mouth. These ulcers can be small or large and often have a white or yellow center with a red border.
They can appear on the tongue, lips, gums, or inside the cheeks. Recurrent mouth ulcers can make eating, drinking, and talking uncomfortable and can last for about one to two weeks.
