Steps involved in Tympanomastoidectomy Surgery
Tympanomastoidectomy surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia in a hospital or surgical center.
The surgeon makes an incision behind the ear to access the middle ear and mastoid bone.
Infected or damaged tissue is removed from the middle ear and mastoid bone.
The surgeon may repair the tympanic membrane and reconstruct the middle ear structures if necessary.
The incision is closed, and the ear is bandaged to promote healing.
Tympanomastoidectomy surgery may take several hours to complete, depending on the extent of the damage and the complexity of the procedure. Your surgeon will provide detailed instructions on post-operative care and follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery.
