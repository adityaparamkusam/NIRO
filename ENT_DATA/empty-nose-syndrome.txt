Empty Nose Syndrome: Diagnosis and Treatment
Empty Nose Syndrome (ENS) is a condition where the nose loses its ability to humidify and filter air properly, even though it feels "empty." This can lead to breathing difficulties and a range of symptoms like dryness, congestion, and difficulty breathing. ENS is significant as it can greatly impact a person's quality of life. While not very common, it's crucial to recognize its symptoms early for appropriate management. If you suspect ENS, seek help from an ENT specialist for proper evaluation and treatment.
Causes of Empty Nose Syndrome
Empty Nose Syndrome (ENS) can develop due to various factors such as:
Turbinate reduction surgery
Incorrect surgical technique
Overly aggressive tissue removal
Loss of normal airflow dynamics
