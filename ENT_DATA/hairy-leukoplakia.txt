Hairy Leukoplakia: Causes, Diagnosis and Treatment
Hairy leukoplakia is a condition where white patches develop on the sides of the tongue, often with a "hairy" appearance. While not painful or harmful, it can indicate a weakened immune system, commonly seen in individuals with HIV/AIDS. This condition is more prevalent in people with compromised immune systems, affecting around 25% of individuals with HIV. If you notice unusual patches on your tongue, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and management.
Causes of Hairy Leukoplakia
Hairy leukoplakia develops due to a weakened immune system, typically associated with conditions like HIV/AIDS or organ transplantation. The main factors contributing to its development include:
Presence of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in the body
Suppressed immune system
Smoking or tobacco use
Poor oral hygiene
