Sinus Augmentation: Indications and Recovery
Sinus augmentation, also known as
sinus lift surgery
, is a common procedure performed to increase bone density in the upper jaw area to support dental implants.
This surgical technique is especially beneficial for individuals who have experienced bone loss in the jaw due to missing teeth or periodontal disease.
By undergoing sinus augmentation surgery, patients can restore the necessary bone structure needed for successful dental implant placement.
If you are considering sinus augmentation surgery, it is essential to consult with a qualified oral surgeon who specializes in this procedure.
They will assess your individual needs and create a customized treatment plan to achieve the best results for your dental health.
Indications of Sinus Augmentation
Sinus augmentation is typically recommended for individuals who require dental implants in the upper jaw area but lack sufficient bone density for successful implant placement.
Bone loss in the upper jaw due to missing teeth
Periodontal disease leading to bone deterioration
Insufficient bone structure to support dental implants
Desire for a permanent solution to restore missing teeth
If you experience any of these issues and are considering dental implants, sinus augmentation may be the right treatment option for you. Consult with your oral surgeon to determine if you are a suitable candidate for this procedure.
Steps involved in Sinus Augmentation Surgery
Sinus augmentation surgery involves several key steps to prepare the jaw for dental implant placement.
Initial consultation and assessment to determine the need for sinus augmentation
Pre-operative imaging such as X-rays or CT scans to evaluate bone density
Administration of anesthesia to ensure patient comfort during the procedure
Creation of a small incision in the gum tissue to access the sinus cavity
Grafting of bone material into the sinus cavity to increase bone density
Closure of the incision and post-operative care instructions for optimal healing
By following these steps, your oral surgeon can effectively perform sinus augmentation surgery to enhance bone density in the upper jaw area and prepare for dental implant placement.
Who will perform Sinus Augmentation Surgery?
Sinus augmentation surgery is typically performed by an experienced oral surgeon who specializes in implant dentistry. These professionals have advanced training and expertise in performing surgical procedures to restore bone density in the jaw and prepare for dental implants.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is sinus augmentation surgery?
Sinus augmentation surgery is a procedure to add bone to the upper jaw in the area of the molars and premolars to prepare for dental implants.
How is sinus augmentation performed?
Sinus augmentation involves adding bone to the upper jaw in the area of the molars and premolars. This is done to make the jawbone taller and allow for the placement of dental implants.
Why is sinus augmentation necessary before dental implant placement?
Sinus augmentation is needed before a dental implant to ensure there is enough bone in the upper jaw to support the implant securely. It helps provide a stable foundation for the implant to be successful in the long term.
How long does recovery take after sinus augmentation surgery?
Recovery after sinus augmentation surgery typically takes about 7-10 days. You may experience swelling, minor bleeding, and some discomfort during this time.
What are the risks of sinus augmentation surgery?
Risks of sinus augmentation surgery may include infection, bleeding, sinusitis, and potential damage to surrounding structures like nerves or blood vessels. Your surgeon will discuss these risks with you before the procedure.
How successful is sinus augmentation in preparing the sinus for implants?
Sinus augmentation is a successful procedure that helps create enough bone in the upper jaw to support dental implants.
Can sinus augmentation be done on both sides of the sinus?
Yes, sinus augmentation can be performed on both sides of the sinuses if needed to increase the bone height for dental implants.
How does sinus augmentation affect sinus function?
Sinus augmentation surgery typically does not affect sinus function. It helps create more bone in the upper jaw for dental implants without impacting normal sinus activities.
What are the complications that can arise after sinus augmentation?
Complications after sinus augmentation may include swelling, pain, bleeding, infection, sinusitis, damage to surrounding structures, or failure of the bone graft to integrate properly.
Is sinus augmentation surgery covered by insurance?
