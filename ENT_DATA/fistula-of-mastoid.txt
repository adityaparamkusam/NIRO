Fistula of Mastoid: Diagnosis and Treatment
Fistula of the mastoid is an abnormal passage that forms between the mastoid bone in the skull and the outer
ear canal
. This condition is significant as it can lead to recurring ear infections, drainage from the ear, and
hearing loss
if left untreated. While not very common, it can occur due to chronic ear infections or previous ear surgeries. Seeking medical attention is crucial to prevent complications and preserve hearing. If you experience symptoms like
ear discharge
or pain, consult an ENT specialist promptly.
Causes of Fistula Of Mastoid
Fistula of the mastoid can develop due to various factors. These include chronic ear infections, trauma to the ear or head, previous ear surgeries, or untreated
cholesteatoma
(a type of skin cyst in the middle ear). Additionally, genetic predisposition, immune system disorders, and certain medical conditions like diabetes can also contribute to fistula formation. It's essential to seek medical attention if you experience symptoms like ear discharge, hearing loss, or
ear pain
to prevent complications. Remember, early detection and treatment play a crucial role in managing mastoid fistulas.
